# Mystery Dungeon Tracker
An app to keep track of your Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (1 and 2) recruiting progress. This is the local version if you wish to run it directly on your machine. **The web version is available [here](https://pa5sarinho.github.io/).**

The pokemon dataset I gathered and used for this is available in my other repository: https://github.com/pa5sarinho/pmd_dataset
